# Software needed

## Python

We will need Python > 3.5 version.
Linux and Mac users should have both 2.7.x and > 3.6.x versions installed by default on their machines. You can check your current version for both of them with:
- python --version 
- python3--version

Windows users please go at https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and get the appropriate file for your PC. Please note that during the installation you will be asked to add Python in Path. You should enable this option.

It allows you to run your files on cmd by: 

```
python python_file.py
```

If you do not enable this you will be forced to use the full python path to execute your programs. (for example, it will be something like: 
c:/users/username/program files/python36/python pytthon_file.py )

## IDE 

This is up to you. Some recommendations:
- VS Code https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- PyCharm Community edition (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/downloadr
