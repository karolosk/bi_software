# Software needed

## Python

We will need Python > 3.5 version.
Linux and Mac users should have both 2.7.x and > 3.6.x versions installed by default on their machines. You can check your current version for both of them with:
- python --version 
- python3--version

Windows users please go at https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and get the appropriate file for your PC. Please note that during the installation you will be asked to add Python in Path. You should enable this option.
